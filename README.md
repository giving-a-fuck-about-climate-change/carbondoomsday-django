# carbondoomsday

A [Django] and [React.js] web application for climate change data inspired by
[no one giving a fuck].

[Django]: https://www.djangoproject.com/
[React.js]: https://facebook.github.io/react/
[no one giving a fuck]: http://titojankowski.com/no-one-gives-a-fck-about-climate-change/

This is a community driven project which aims to bring all levels of
contributor to engage in providing a reliable, free (price and [freedom]) and
feature packed web API to allow front-end client creators consume climate
change related data in order to fuel a new wave of interesting and engaging
visualisations and interactive environments to help us all understand and more
importantly, to act on stopping the ongoing trend of [ecocide].
