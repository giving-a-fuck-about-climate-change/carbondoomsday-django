# carbondoomsday

A [Django] web API for climate change related data inspired by [no one giving a fuck].

[Django]: https://www.djangoproject.com/
[no one giving a fuck]: http://titojankowski.com/no-one-gives-a-fck-about-climate-change/

Climate change related data is largely free to access from various scientific
bodies but is distributed in inconvenient formats for web services to consume.
We want to scrape and gather what we can and expose it on the usual well known
RESTish web API interface.

This is a community driven project which aims to bring all levels of
contributor to engage in providing a reliable, [free] and feature packed web
API. Please see the [contribution documentation] if you'd like to help out.

[free]: https://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html
[contribution documentation]: https://github.com/giving-a-fuck-about-climate-change/carbondoomsday/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

We hope to provide front-end client creators consume climate change related
data in order to fuel a new wave of interesting and engaging visualisations and
interactive environments. Please see the [Swagger API documentation] to get
started. The service is currently hosted on the Heroku free tier. Response
times may vary.
